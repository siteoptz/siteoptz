# Vercel Build Errors - Compacted

## Critical Errors (TypeError)

### 1. Pricing Data Structure Errors
```
TypeError: e.pricing.some is not a function
TypeError: e.pricing.map is not a function
```
**Location**: Multiple comparison pages
**Issue**: The `pricing` property is not an array as expected by the code

### 2. Undefined Object Access Errors
```
TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object
```
**Location**: `/demo` page
**Issue**: Trying to spread or convert undefined/null values

### 3. Missing Description Property
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'description')
```
**Location**: Multiple tool and comparison pages
**Issue**: Tool objects missing the `description` property

## Warnings (Performance & Best Practices)

### 1. Image Optimization
```
Warning: Using <img> could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using <Image /> from next/image
```
**Issue**: Using regular `<img>` tags instead of Next.js optimized `<Image />` component

### 2. React Hook Dependencies
```
Warning: React Hook [HookName] has missing dependencies: ...
Warning: The '[variable]' object makes the dependencies of [HookName] Hook ... change on every render
```
**Issue**: Missing dependencies in useEffect/useCallback hooks and objects not memoized

### 3. Data Size Warning
```
Warning: data for page "/tools/[slug]" (path "/tools/midjourney/") is 128 kB which exceeds the threshold of 128 kB
```
**Issue**: Individual tool pages have too much data, affecting performance

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issues appear to be:

1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The generated AI tools data has a different structure than what the frontend components expect
2. **Missing Properties**: Some tools are missing required properties like `description` and `pricing`
3. **Type Mismatches**: `pricing` is expected to be an array but may be a string or object
4. **Performance Issues**: Large data payloads and non-optimized components

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Update Data Structure**: Ensure all tools have consistent properties
2. **Add Data Validation**: Validate data before rendering
3. **Fix Component Logic**: Handle missing/undefined properties gracefully
4. **Optimize Images**: Replace `<img>` with Next.js `<Image />`
5. **Memoize Objects**: Use `useMemo` for expensive computations
6. **Reduce Data Size**: Split large tool data into smaller chunks
