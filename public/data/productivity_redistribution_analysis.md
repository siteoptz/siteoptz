## Key Principles Applied

1. **Specificity Over Generality:** Tools with specific domain functionality (e.g., data analysis, code generation) were moved to appropriate specialized categories.

2. **Primary Function Focus:** Categorization based on the tool's primary purpose rather than secondary productivity benefits.

3. **User Intent Alignment:** Categories reflect what users would likely search for when looking for these types of tools.

4. **Functional Clarity:** Each tool moved to a category where its core functionality is the primary focus of that category.

## Recommended Implementation

1. **Phase 1:** Move tools with clear, unambiguous functionality (e.g., data analysis, code generation, voice AI)
2. **Phase 2:** Review and move business-specific tools (sales, marketing, email marketing)  
3. **Phase 3:** Final review of remaining productivity tools to ensure they are truly general productivity focused

## Benefits of Redistribution

- **Improved Discoverability:** Users can find tools more easily in relevant categories
- **Better User Experience:** More accurate categorization aligns with user expectations
- **Cleaner Taxonomy:** Reduces the overly broad "Productivity" category
- **SEO Benefits:** More specific categories improve search relevance
- **Content Organization:** Better matches actual tool functionality

This redistribution will result in a more organized, user-friendly tool directory where the "Productivity" category contains only tools that are genuinely focused on general productivity enhancement rather than domain-specific applications.
