## **OUR APPROACH**

Our approach is quite simple…streamline humans and machines to interoperate at every step of the marketing journey, from building business intelligence to delivering hyper-personalized creative.

But most importantly, our approach is centered around a complimentary 360-degree audit where we will present to you a long-term value proposition that encompasses our end-to-end offering. After we evaluate this with you and your team, we will tailor a monthly strategy plan to meet your needs and budget in a phased approach.

Moreover, to prove results, we run on a Scrum Framework on 90-day commitments.

This means that rather than being your ‘agency of record’ and locking you into a twelve-month commitment, our team treats each engagement as a 90-Day project that is broken into 12-weekly sprints.

99% of our clients are looking to do one of three things:

- Reduce Cost Per Lead (CPL)
- Reduce Cost to Acquire a New Customer (CAC)

With clearly established Key Performance Indicators, we can work with you to assign a 90-Day milestone. That way you’ll know whether we have achieved your goals at the end of the 90-Days.

We either hit them, or we don’t, there is no gray area, and we believe that that’s the way it should be.

The 90-Day Agreement ensures that both SiteOptz and our clients remain focused on short-term goals and not bogged down by long-term commitments.

## About Our VIP Program

There’s simply no shortcut, no magic app, no substitute for what we’ve learned throughout the years in optimizing ROI for our clients across a mix of marketing strategies & tactics. Our optimization analysts utilize a proprietary platform that aggregates and processes millions of data points each day.

But the value is not in generating massive reports with a plethora of metrics…our focus is on succinctly delivering executive level insights on your key performance indicators. It’s dashboard reporting, backed by unparalleled personal service from legit digital experts. Such is the inspirational, driving force behind our VIP Program.

### Top Notch Data Quality

With over twenty full time developers on staff, we continue to add to dozens of API integrations with leading digital marketing tech solutions to ensure that you have the most holistic perspective on your customer’s journey.

### Insights for Executives

Whether outsourcing or handling in-house, often times the most significant challenge is not in volume of data but gaining wisdom from data. Our team of analysts provide custom performance dashboards that deliver actionable insights and are easily understood at the C-suite level.

### Delivering on Growth Goals

Depending on your traffic acquisition and/or conversion rate optimization strategy, our analysts become an extension of your team and together we strive to meet or exceed all of your growth goals. Leveraging a powerful tech architecture, we pride ourselves on providing meaningful insights across the digital media landscape.
