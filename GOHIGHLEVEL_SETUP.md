# GoHighLevel Integration Setup

## Overview
This document describes the GoHighLevel CRM integration for the SiteOptz lead capture system.

## Current Integration Features

### 1. Automatic Lead Creation
Every form submission on the SiteOptz website automatically creates a new contact in GoHighLevel with:

- **Contact Information**: First name, last name, email, company
- **Lead Tags**:
  - `New Lead` - Triggers the 'New Lead Workflow'
  - `Resource Download` - Identifies source
  - Downloaded resource name
  - Company size
  - Role/position
  - Interest area
  - Timeline
  - Marketing consent status
  - Source month/year

### 2. Email Notifications
- **Primary Email**: Sent to the lead with download link
- **BCC Copy**: Always sent to `info@siteoptz.ai` for tracking
- **Email Provider**: SendGrid (primary) with SMTP fallback

### 3. Workflow Automation
Leads are automatically added to the 'New Lead Workflow' in GoHighLevel for:
- Welcome email sequences
- Lead nurturing campaigns
- Sales follow-up tasks
- Lead scoring and qualification
