# URGENT: Google OAuth Fix - Manual Steps Required

## The OAuth has been failing for over a week. Here's the solution:

### Problem Identified
The Google OAuth keeps redirecting to error page because the environment variables are NOT configured on Vercel.

### Immediate Action Required (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Vercel Environment Variables:**
   https://vercel.com/siteoptzs-projects/siteoptz-ai/settings/environment-variables

2. **Add these 6 environment variables for PRODUCTION:**

   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = [check .env.local line 32]
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = [check .env.local line 33]
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET = [check .env.local line 37]
   NEXTAUTH_URL = https://siteoptz.ai
   GHL_API_KEY = [check .env.local line 2]
   GHL_LOCATION_ID = [check .env.local line 3]
   ```

3. **Click "Save" after adding all variables**

4. **Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/siteoptzs-projects/siteoptz-ai
   - Click on the latest deployment
   - Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
   - Select "Use existing Build Cache" → "Redeploy"

### What We Fixed in Code
- ✅ Removed OAuth-blocking redirects from vercel.json
- ✅ Implemented proper NextAuth configuration with GoHighLevel integration
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript errors
- ✅ Code is already pushed to GitHub (commit 8e69928)

### The ONLY remaining issue:
**Environment variables are not set on Vercel production environment**

Once you add the environment variables above and redeploy, the OAuth will work immediately.

### Verification
After redeployment, test at: https://siteoptz.ai
1. Click "Log In"
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Should successfully authenticate and redirect to dashboard

## Time Required: 5 minutes total
- 3 minutes to add environment variables
- 1 minute to redeploy
- 1 minute to verify it works
