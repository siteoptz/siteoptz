# Compare URL Redirect Solution

## Problem
The site was experiencing 2,570+ 404 errors for compare URLs that were using an incorrect format:
- **Incorrect format**: `/compare/tool1-vs-tool2`
- **Correct format**: `/compare/tool1/vs/tool2`

## Solution Implemented
Created a Next.js middleware (`middleware.ts`) that automatically redirects incorrect URL formats to the correct format using 301 permanent redirects.

## How It Works

The middleware intercepts all requests to `/compare/` URLs and:

1. **Detects malformed URLs** with patterns like:
   - `/compare/tool1-vs-tool2` → redirects to `/compare/tool1/vs/tool2`
   - `/compare/tool1_vs_tool2` → redirects to `/compare/tool1/vs/tool2`
   - `/compare/tool1-versus-tool2` → redirects to `/compare/tool1/vs/tool2`
   - `/compare/tool1/tool2` (missing 'vs') → redirects to `/compare/tool1/vs/tool2`

2. **Preserves query parameters** during redirects

3. **Uses 301 permanent redirects** for SEO optimization

4. **Handles edge cases**:
   - Tool names containing hyphens
   - Tool names containing 'vs' within the name
   - Multiple path segment variations

## Benefits

1. **Immediate fix** for all 2,570+ broken URLs
2. **SEO preservation** through 301 redirects
3. **Future-proof** - handles any new malformed URLs automatically
4. **No database changes** required
5. **Zero downtime** deployment

## Testing

The middleware has been tested with sample URLs from the error log and successfully redirects:
- ✅ `/compare/fenn-vs-adcreative-ai` → `/compare/fenn/vs/adcreative-ai`
- ✅ `/compare/fiddler-ai-vs-10web` → `/compare/fiddler-ai/vs/10web`
- ✅ `/compare/fireflies-vs-adespresso` → `/compare/fireflies/vs/adespresso`

## Deployment

The middleware is automatically active after building and deploying:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Monitoring

Monitor redirect effectiveness by:
1. Checking server logs for `[Middleware] Redirecting` messages
2. Verifying 404 error reduction in analytics
3. Testing sample URLs from the original error log

## Future Improvements

If needed, the middleware can be extended to:
- Log redirects to a database for analytics
- Handle additional URL pattern variations
- Add custom redirect rules for specific tools
