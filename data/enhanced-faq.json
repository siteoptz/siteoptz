    {
      "question": "What's the difference between GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini?",
      "answer": "GPT-4 (OpenAI) excels at creative writing and code generation, Claude (Anthropic) is known for safety and detailed analysis, while Gemini (Google) integrates well with Google services and multimodal tasks. Each has different context windows, training data, and strengths. GPT-4 has the largest ecosystem, Claude focuses on helpfulness and safety, and Gemini offers strong reasoning capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I choose the right AI tool for my business?",
      "answer": "Consider these factors: 1) Specific use case and requirements, 2) Integration with existing tools, 3) Pricing and budget constraints, 4) Data privacy and security needs, 5) Ease of use and learning curve, 6) Customer support quality, 7) Scalability options. Start with free trials to test functionality before committing to paid plans."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need technical skills to use AI tools?",
      "answer": "Most modern AI tools are designed for non-technical users with intuitive interfaces and no coding required. However, advanced features or API integrations may benefit from technical knowledge. Many tools offer tutorials, documentation, and customer support to help users get started regardless of technical background."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are AI tools?",
      "answer": "AI tool accuracy varies by task and tool. For factual information, always verify outputs as AI can sometimes generate inaccurate or outdated information. For creative tasks, accuracy is more subjective. Best practices include fact-checking, using multiple tools for comparison, and maintaining human oversight for critical decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the legal considerations when using AI tools?",
      "answer": "Key legal considerations include: 1) Copyright and intellectual property of AI-generated content, 2) Data privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA), 3) Terms of service and usage restrictions, 4) Professional liability for AI-assisted work, 5) Industry-specific regulations. Consult legal counsel for specific use cases and maintain awareness of evolving AI legislation."
